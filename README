This script is intended to read in a csv that contains 
addresses that can be geocoded (using Google API) and written
out to a new csv file to be processed later.

The process will read the geocoded data into a google maps template
to display a given sales agent's appointments.

TODO:
Determine how to dynamically zoom in/out appropriately so it is
possible to autogenerate pdfs of the final result to the client vs.
sending html files as the final product.
